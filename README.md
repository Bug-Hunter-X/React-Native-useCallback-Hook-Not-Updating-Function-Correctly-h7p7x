# React Native useCallback Hook Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native. The problem arises when the function passed to `useCallback` relies on a state variable, and the state changes, but the function within `useCallback` doesn't update correctly. This leads to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in the component.

## Problem Description
The `useCallback` hook is intended to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders. However, if the memoized function uses a state variable, changes in that state may not cause the function itself to update. This can lead to stale closures, causing the component to use an outdated version of the state variable, ultimately resulting in bugs.

## How to Reproduce
Clone this repository, and run the example provided to observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the dependencies array passed to `useCallback` includes all the state variables the function depends on. By doing so, whenever those state variables change, the function is re-created, thus resolving the stale closure issue. The improved code demonstrates the correct implementation.

## Additional Notes
This issue is specific to using `useCallback` within functional components with state.  Make sure you understand the implications of using `useCallback` and its dependencies array. Refer to the official React documentation for additional information.
